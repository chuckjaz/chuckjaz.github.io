After a brief interlude, this site is now back up.
I use a server in <a href="http://www.urbanpotato.net/">Brian's </a>home to host
this blog. Brian gives some reasons for the temporary outage
<a href="http://www.urbanpotato.net/Default.aspx/document/2210">here</a>. This,
of course doesn't explain why I don't have at least one real blog entry queued
up ready to go. Let's just say, that Brian's machine wasn't the only thing under
the weather lately...
