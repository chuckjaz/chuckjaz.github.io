I have moved my blog once again. It has been hosted on an [Azure][3] instance
for about 2 years now. In that time I have had exactly one post, the one
describing that I was now running my blog on the Azure instance using
BlogEngine.net.

I have now moved once again, but this time I am using [Jeykll][1]. There are
several advantages to running on [Jeykll][1] and [GitHub][2]. One, it is
free. Second, the blog entires are under version control. Third, I can write
my posts in Markdown instead of of authoring them in raw html. Fourth, I can
preview changes to my blog locally before pushing them live.

I might have been able to do these things with BlogEngine.net, I don't know. I
never bothered to find out. I never found the blog engine convienent to author
posts in and it posed another barrier to my blogging regularly.

In the move to BlogEngine.net I, unfortunately, lost all the comments for my
blog. This is partically unfortunate for [Fatherly Advice To New Programmers][4],
my most popular and well received blog post.

I shut down comments to my blog at the time I moved to BlogEngine.net and
[Azure][3] because I spent most of my time deleting spam comments than actually
writing blog entires. I have re-enabled them with the move to Jekyll by using
[disqus][5] as my comment server. Hopefully I will be able to manage my comments
better and get less comment spam.
